# TowerOfHanoi-HTML-CSS-JS

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic puzzle game \"*Tower of Hanoi*\".

The game includes the following features:

-   **Step count:** This keeps track of the number of moves it takes to
    solve the puzzle.

-   **Timer:** It tracks the amount of time taken to solve the puzzle.
    If the player runs out of time, the game is stopped.

-   **Change the number of plates:** This allows the player to adjust
    the number of discs used in the puzzle. The range is from 0 to 9.

-   **Undo/Redo:** This allows the player to undo or redo all their
    moves since the start.

-   **Constraint:** A large plate cannot be moved onto a smaller plate.

This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
provides a basic understanding of web development and its concepts.
